# GURPS 3E Homebrew Character Generator

A GURPS 3E/4E hybrid character generator based on homebrew rules for a campaign I participated in.

## Development
1. Install the project dependencies by running:
```bash
npm install
```
2. To start the development server, run:
```bash
npm run dev
```

This command will start a local development server at ``http://localhost:3000`` (or a different port if 3000 is in use). The server will hot-reload if you make edits to any of the source files.

## Building the App
To build the application for production, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
This command will generate a dist folder containing the production build of your app. Vite optimizes your project for the best performance during this process.

## Running the App Locally
After building the app, you can serve it locally using:
```bash
npm run preview
```
This command serves the production build from the dist folder, allowing you to preview the app before deployment.
